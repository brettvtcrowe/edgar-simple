# Phase 3: Intelligence Engine - Planning & Architecture

## 🎯 **Phase 3 Overview**
**Goal**: Transform the Regulatory Intelligence Hub from mock data to live SEC filing analysis with natural language query capabilities

**Timeline**: Months 3-4
**Success Criteria**: Users can ask natural language questions about SEC filings and receive accurate, live data responses

---

## 🔍 **Natural Language Query Requirements Analysis**

### **Core Query Types to Support**
1. **Filing Type + Time + Content**: "8-K filings from past three years with restatements"
2. **Accounting Standard + Company Type**: "ASC 606 revenue recognition in life sciences"
3. **Policy Comparison**: "Compare Microsoft's revenue recognition across 5 years"
4. **Industry + Accounting Method**: "Milestone method usage in healthcare companies"
5. **Complex Correlation**: "Segment changes within 12 months of acquisition"

### **Query Processing Requirements**
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Parse complex accounting queries
- **Temporal Logic**: "past three years", "within 12 months", "last five filings"
- **Industry Classification**: "cryptocurrency", "life sciences", "technology"
- **Accounting Concept Mapping**: "ASC 606", "milestone method", "failed sales"
- **Multi-Entity Search**: Company-specific vs. industry-wide queries

### **2. Live Data Integration Layer**
```
SEC APIs → Data Processor → Content Extractor → Indexer → Query Engine
```

**Data Sources**:
- **Company Filings**: 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, S-1, S-3, 424B3
- **Company Information**: Tickers, CIKs, industry classifications
- **Filing Content**: Full text, exhibits, financial statements
- **Metadata**: Filing dates, form types, company information

### **3. Content Analysis Engine**
```
Raw Filing → Text Extraction → Accounting Concept Detection → Policy Analysis → Insights
```

**Analysis Capabilities**:
- **Accounting Standard Detection**: ASC 606, ASC 860, FASB standards
- **Policy Change Detection**: Text comparison across filings
- **Industry Classification**: Company sector identification
- **Risk Factor Analysis**: Restatement, modification, change detection

## 📊 **Query Processing Examples**

### **Example 1: 8-K Restatements**
```
Input: "Please find all 8-K filings from the past three years that report a restatement under Item 4.02 related to revenue recognition"

Processing:
1. NLP Parser: Extract entities
   - Filing Type: "8-K"
   - Timeframe: "past three years" → [2021-01-01, 2024-12-31]
   - Content: "restatement", "Item 4.02", "revenue recognition"
   - Intent: SEARCH_FILINGS

2. Query Builder: Construct SEC API query
   - Form Type: 8-K
   - Date Range: 2021-01-01 to 2024-12-31
   - Keywords: ["restatement", "Item 4.02", "revenue recognition"]
   - ASC Reference: ASC 606

3. Content Analysis: Process results
   - Filter for restatement disclosures
   - Extract Item 4.02 content
   - Identify revenue recognition context
   - Generate summary and links
```

### **Example 2: Policy Comparison**
```
Input: "Compare Microsoft's revenue recognition policy disclosures in its last five 10-K filings"

Processing:
1. NLP Parser: Extract entities
   - Company: "Microsoft"
   - Filing Type: "10-K"
   - Quantity: "last five"
   - Content: "revenue recognition policy"
   - Intent: COMPARE_POLICIES

2. Query Builder: Construct company-specific query
   - Company: MSFT (Microsoft)
   - Form Type: 10-K
   - Count: 5 most recent
   - Content Focus: Revenue recognition policy sections

3. Content Analysis: Policy comparison
   - Extract policy text from each filing
   - Perform text similarity analysis
   - Identify changes in wording and policy
   - Highlight modifications and references

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

### **NLP Pipeline Testing**
```python
def test_query_parsing():
    """Test natural language query understanding"""
    queries = [
        "Find 8-K filings about restatements",
        "Compare Microsoft's revenue recognition policy",
        "Life sciences companies using milestone method"
    ]
    
    for query in queries:
        result = nlp_engine.parse_query(query)
        assert result.intent is not None
        assert result.entities is not None
        assert result.timeframe is not None

def test_accounting_concept_detection():
    """Test accounting standard and concept identification"""
    filing_text = "Company adopted ASC 606 revenue recognition standard..."
    concepts = content_analyzer.extract_accounting_concepts(filing_text)
    
    assert "ASC 606" in concepts
    assert "revenue recognition" in concepts
```

### **Integration Testing**
```python
def test_end_to_end_query():
    """Test complete query processing pipeline"""
    query = "Find 8-K filings from past year about restatements"
    
    # Process through entire pipeline
    result = process_natural_language_query(query)
    
    # Verify results
    assert result.filings is not None
    assert len(result.filings) > 0
    assert all(f.form_type == "8-K" for f in result.filings)
    assert all("restatement" in f.content for f in result.filings)
```
