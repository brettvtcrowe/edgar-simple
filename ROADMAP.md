# Development Roadmap: Regulatory Intelligence Hub

## Overview

This document outlines our Test-Driven Development (TDD) strategy for building the **Regulatory Intelligence Hub** - a comprehensive platform that transforms raw SEC filing data into actionable regulatory intelligence for legal teams and regulatory consultants.

**This project has evolved from a simple SEC filing lookup tool to a comprehensive regulatory intelligence platform.**

## Strategic Vision

### Core Value Proposition
Transform regulatory data into **strategic intelligence** that helps professionals:
- Anticipate regulatory trends before they become obvious
- Identify sector-wide compliance patterns and risks
- Benchmark client performance against industry standards
- Provide data-driven regulatory advice to clients

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Legal teams and regulatory consultants
- **Secondary**: Compliance officers, investment analysts, auditors

## TDD Principles for This Project

### Rule 1: This Has to Work as Intended
- Every feature must be tested before implementation
- All tests must pass before moving to the next phase
- Quality over speed - working code is better than fast code

### Rule 2: No Wasted Time on Development Rabbit Holes
- If something isn't working after 3 attempts, pivot
- Focus on delivering value, not perfecting tools
- Use proven, simple solutions over complex experiments

### TDD Cycle: Red-Green-Refactor
1. **Red**: Write failing tests for desired functionality
2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to make tests pass
3. **Refactor**: Clean up and optimize the working code
