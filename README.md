# Regulatory Intelligence Hub

## Overview

**This project has evolved from a simple SEC filing lookup tool to a comprehensive Regulatory Intelligence Hub.**

The Regulatory Intelligence Hub transforms raw SEC filing data into actionable regulatory intelligence for legal teams and regulatory consultants. This platform provides sector-wide analysis, regulatory trend tracking, and big-picture insights that go far beyond individual company data.

## Development Approach: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**This project follows strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles throughout all phases.**

### TDD Core Principles
- **Rule 1**: This has to work as intended - every feature must be tested before implementation
- **Rule 2**: No wasted time on development rabbit holes - tests provide immediate feedback
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Write failing tests first, implement to pass, then refactor
- **Continuous Testing**: All code changes must pass tests before proceeding

### Why TDD for This Project
- **Complex Regulatory Domain**: TDD ensures accuracy in regulatory data processing
- **Multi-Phase Development**: Tests provide confidence when building on previous phases
- **Quality Assurance**: Critical for regulatory intelligence that professionals will rely on
- **Efficient Development**: Prevents rabbit holes and ensures working code at each step

**See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for detailed TDD implementation and current testing status.**

## Current Status

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED)
- Basic SEC filing lookup functionality
- SEC API integration working
- Simple web interface

### ✅ Phase 2: Enhanced Foundation (COMPLETED)
- Enhanced SEC filing search with sector analysis
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Sector intelligence and dashboards
- **15/15 tests passing (100% success rate)**

### ⏳ Future Phases
- **Phase 3**: Intelligence Engine (ML/NLP capabilities)
- **Phase 4**: Multi-Source Integration (Comment letters, FASB standards)
- **Phase 5**: Advanced Analytics & Reporting

## Quick Start (Current Functionality)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd edgar-v1/edgar-simple
npm install
npm start
```

### Usage
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Enter a stock ticker (e.g., AAPL, NVDA, MSFT)
3. View the latest 10 SEC filings with direct links

## Architecture & Roadmap

**For detailed architecture, technical specifications, and implementation roadmap, see:**
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Comprehensive architecture and roadmap
- **[ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md)** - Development phases and TDD approach

## What This App Does

### Current Capabilities
1. **Basic SEC Filing Lookup**: Enter a ticker to get recent filings
2. **Direct SEC Links**: Clickable links that go directly to SEC documents
3. **Real-Time Data**: Fetches current data from SEC's official API
4. **Advanced Search**: Form type filtering, date ranges, keyword search
5. **Sector Analysis**: Industry grouping and comparative analysis
6. **Trend Detection**: Pattern recognition across filings
7. **Risk Scoring**: Automated risk assessment based on filing patterns

### Planned Capabilities (Phase 3+)
1. **Natural Language Processing**: Content analysis and insight extraction
2. **Advanced Pattern Recognition**: ML-powered trend detection
3. **Multi-Source Integration**: Comment letters, FASB standards, M&A data
4. **Predictive Analytics**: Regulatory trend forecasting
5. **Advanced Reporting**: Custom dashboards and export capabilities

## Development Approach

This project follows **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles:
- **Rule 1**: This has to work as intended
- **Rule 2**: No wasted time on development rabbit holes

See **[ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md)** for detailed development phases and testing strategy.

## SEC API Integration

The app integrates with SEC's official APIs:
- **Company Tickers**: https://www.sec.gov/files/company_tickers.json
- **Company Filings**: https://data.sec.gov/submissions/CIK{CIK}.json

**Important**: Always honor the 10 requests per second rate limit.

## Enhanced API Endpoints

### Core Filing Lookup
- **`POST /api/filings`** - Basic ticker-based filing lookup
  - **Body**: `{ "ticker": "AAPL" }`
  - **Returns**: Company info and latest 10 filings with direct SEC links

### Advanced Search & Analytics
- **`POST /api/search/advanced`** - Advanced filing search
  - **Body**: `{ "formType": "8-K", "sector": "Technology", "dateRange": "1year", "keywords": "restatement" }`
  - **Returns**: Filtered filing results based on criteria

- **`GET /api/sectors`** - List all available sectors
  - **Returns**: Sector information with descriptions and risk factors

- **`GET /api/sectors/:sector/analytics`** - Sector-specific analytics
  - **Returns**: Filing counts, risk scores, top forms, and trends

- **`GET /api/trends`** - Filing trends analysis
  - **Query**: `?period=6months` (valid: 6months, 1year, 2years, 3years, 5years)
  - **Returns**: Filing trends with sector breakdown

### Search Parameters
- **formType**: 8-K, 10-K, 10-Q, S-1, S-3, 424B3
- **sector**: Technology, Healthcare, Financial, Energy, Consumer, Industrial, Other
- **dateRange**: 6months, 1year, 2years, 3years, 5years
- **keywords**: Free-text search in filing descriptions

### Example API Usage
```bash
# Search for 8-K filings about restatements in Technology sector
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/search/advanced \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"formType": "8-K", "sector": "Technology", "keywords": "restatement"}'

# Get Technology sector analytics
curl http://localhost:3000/api/sectors/Technology/analytics

# Get 6-month filing trends
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/trends?period=6months"
```
