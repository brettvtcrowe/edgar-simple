# Regulatory Intelligence Hub

A sophisticated application for analyzing SEC filings using natural language queries and live data integration.

## 🚀 **Current Status: Phase 3 TDD Cycle 4 COMPLETE**

### **✅ What's Working RIGHT NOW**

#### **Production App (Live at https://edgar-simple.vercel.app/)**
- **Real SEC Data Integration**: Live SEC API connection working
- **Company Filing Lookup**: Enter ticker → Get actual SEC filings
- **Enhanced Search Interface**: 4-tab interface with filing data
- **Vercel Deployment**: Successfully deployed and accessible

#### **Local Development (Phase 3 Components)**
- **NLP Query Parser**: Natural language understanding working
- **SEC API Client**: Live data retrieval tested and working
- **Content Analysis Engine**: Document parsing, concept detection, policy extraction, risk analysis
- **All Tests Passing**: 14/14 tests across all components

---

### **🔧 What's NOT Available in Production Yet**

#### **Missing Integration**
- **Natural Language Queries**: Users can't type questions like "Find all 8-K filings about restatements"
- **Content Analysis**: Intelligent filing analysis runs locally but isn't connected to production
- **Python Backend**: Sophisticated analysis components aren't deployed

#### **Current Limitation**
Users currently see an enhanced search interface with real SEC data, but can't use natural language queries or get intelligent analysis of filing content.

## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

### **Phase 1 & 2: Complete ✅**
- Basic SEC filing lookup
- Enhanced search interface
- Mock data endpoints
- Frontend overhaul with tabbed interface

### **Phase 3: In Progress 🔄**
- **TDD Cycle 1**: NLP Query Parser ✅ COMPLETE
- **TDD Cycle 2**: Extended NLP Features ✅ COMPLETE
- **TDD Cycle 3**: SEC API Client Integration ✅ COMPLETE
- **TDD Cycle 4**: Content Analysis Engine ✅ COMPLETE
- **TDD Cycle 5**: Hybrid Query Understanding System 🔄 NEXT

## 🎯 **Example of What We're Building**

**Current (Production)**: User types "AAPL" → Gets list of SEC filings

**Future (After TDD Cycle 5)**: User types "Find all 8-K filings from Apple about restatements" → Gets intelligent analysis with:
- Relevant 8-K filings identified
- Content analyzed for restatement mentions
- Risk factors and accounting concepts extracted
- Structured summary of findings

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.12+
- spaCy with English model

### **Local Development**
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/brettvtcrowe/edgar-simple.git
cd edgar-simple

# Node.js backend
npm install
npm start

# Python Phase 3 components
python -m venv phase3_env
source phase3_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: phase3_env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### **Production Access**
- **URL**: https://edgar-simple.vercel.app/
- **Status**: ✅ Deployed and working
- **Functionality**: Enhanced SEC filing search with live data

---

## 📊 **Testing Status**

### **All Tests Passing (14/14)**
- **Phase 1 & 2**: 4/4 tests ✅
- **Phase 3 TDD Cycle 1**: 5/5 tests ✅ (NLP Query Parser)
- **Phase 3 TDD Cycle 2**: 3/3 tests ✅ (Extended NLP)
- **Phase 3 TDD Cycle 3**: 2/2 tests ✅ (SEC API Client)
- **Phase 3 TDD Cycle 4**: 4/4 tests ✅ (Content Analysis)

---

## 🔮 **Next Steps**

### **Immediate (TDD Cycle 5)**
- Build hybrid query understanding system
- Integrate Python components with Node.js backend
- Create natural language query endpoints

### **Short Term**
- Deploy content analysis to production
- Add natural language interface to frontend
- End-to-end testing of complete pipeline

### **Long Term**
- AI-powered filing analysis
- Advanced query capabilities
- Comprehensive regulatory intelligence platform
